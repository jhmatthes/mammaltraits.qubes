# Mammal traits app - QUBES

This is the code that runs a mammal traits [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app on [QUBESHub](https://qubeshub.org).  

This app allows users to visualize relationships among metabolic and life history traits for species-level data that include most living and recently extinct mammals from [Jones et. al. (2009)](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/e090/184/).

**NOTE**:  You must have an account (*which is free*) in order to run Shiny apps on QUBESHub!
